Hello!

I am a fourth year (as of Jan. 2024) PhD candidate at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.
I am fortunate to have [Prof. Benjamin Van Roy](https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/) as my PhD advisor.
I am grateful to being supported by the following: [SCBX](https://www.scbx.com/en/) [Jan. 2024-present] and [Robert Bosch Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf) [2020-23].
My research interests lie broadly in the areas of crowdsourcing, bandit learning and reinforcement learning.   

<!-- organizations that provide me finacial support: [SCBX](https://www.scbx.com/en/) [Jan. 2024-present] and [Robert Bosch Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf) [2020-23] . -->

I graduated with a B.Tech and a M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay where I was awarded
an [Institute Silver Medal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AncwjqGZUTFPR9lsQBF3se01AgsDAXER/view?usp=sharing) and an Undergraduate Research Award. I was fortunate
to have [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/) and 
[Prof. Krishna Jagannathan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~krishnaj/) as my Master's Thesis advisors. 

<!-- I currently suffer from a Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) which makes it difficult for me to type.  I have received enormous support from my parents, advisor and labmates. This has allowed me to keep making progress on research. I am extremely grateful to them for their support.  To supplement my typing, I use [speech-to-text](https://talonvoice.com/) and [handwriting-to-text](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/take-handwritten-notes-in-onenote-0ec88c54-05f3-4cac-b452-9ee62cebbd4c) softwares. I also use a number of computer peripherals to make my life easy. If you want to know more, please contact me via email. -->
