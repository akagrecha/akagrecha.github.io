Hello!

I am a first year PhD student at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.
I am fortunate to be supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship. My research interests lie
broadly in the areas of **learning theory**, **optimization**, **stochastic modelling**, and **information theory**. Specifically, I have worked on problems related to multi-armed bandits
and queueing theory but I seek to explore new areas and learn new tools.

I graduated with a B.Tech and a M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay where I was awarded
an Institute Silver Medal and an Undergraduate Research Award. I was fortunate
to have [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/) and 
[Prof. Krishna Jagannathan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~krishnaj/) as my Master's Thesis advisors. 
I also spent an amazing summer working with [Prof. James Saunderson](https://ecse.monash.edu/staff/james/) at Monash University.

I was very actively involved in the [Department Academic Mentorship Program](https://dampeeiitb.wordpress.com/) at IITB. Looking back, I am happy to have made even a 
tiny difference in the lives of my mentees and being a part of a competitive but a very 
supportive department.
