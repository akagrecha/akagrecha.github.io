Hello!

I am a second year PhD student at the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.
I am fortunate to have [Prof. Benjamin Van Roy](https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/) as my PhD advisor
and I am grateful to be supported by [Robert Bosch Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf).
My research interests lie broadly in the areas of reinforcement learning, information theory, and
applied probability.   

I graduated with a B.Tech and a M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay where I was awarded
an [Institute Silver Medal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AncwjqGZUTFPR9lsQBF3se01AgsDAXER/view?usp=sharing) and an Undergraduate Research Award. I was fortunate
to have [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/) and 
[Prof. Krishna Jagannathan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~krishnaj/) as my Master's Thesis advisors. 

I was very actively involved in the [Department Academic Mentorship Program](https://dampeeiitb.wordpress.com/) at IIT Bombay. 
At Stanford, I have started volunteering as a mentor at [FAST](https://fast.stanford.edu/).
