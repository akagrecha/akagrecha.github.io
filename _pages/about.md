Namaste \_/\\\_

I'm currently a fifth year Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay. My dual degree specialization is Communication and Signal Processing. My research interests lie broadly in the areas of **learning theory**, **optimization**, **stochastic modelling**, and **information theory**. I'm particularly interested in leveraging these tools to solve problems arising in the fields of **social networks**, **communication networks** and **data science**.

I'm fortunate to have [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/) and [Prof. Krishna Jagannathan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~krishnaj/) as my Master's Thesis advisors. We're exploring problems at the intersection of online learning and heavy tailed distributions. I spent a summer at Monash University, where I was hosted by [Prof. James Saunderson](https://ecse.monash.edu/staff/james/). We worked on constructing efficient decoding algorithms with performance guarantees for error-correcting codes using Semidefinite Programming. Early in my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Prof. Swati Patankar](http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/~patankar/) on modelling the translation mechanism in a malaria parasite, *Plasmodium falciparum*.
