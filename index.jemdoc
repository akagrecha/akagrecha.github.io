== About Me

I recently completed my PhD in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I was extremely fortunate to have [https://web.stanford.edu/~bvr/index.html Prof. Benjamin Van Roy] as my PhD advisor, and I also closely collaborated with the inimitable [https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/richard-zeckhauser Prof. Richard Zeckhauser]. I'm grateful to have received the support of the [https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf Robert Bosch Stanford Graduate Fellowship] and a grant from [https://www.scb10x.com/ SCB10X] during my PhD. My research interests lie broadly in the areas of aggregation and learning algorithms. \n\n

Previously, I graduated with a B.Tech and an M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay, where I was awarded an Institute Silver Medal and an Undergraduate Research Award. I was fortunate to have Professors [https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/ Jayakrishnan Nair] and [https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~krishnaj/ Krishna Jagannathan] as my Master's Thesis advisors. \n\n
